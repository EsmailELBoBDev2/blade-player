# Blade (InDev branch)
![logo](Images/horizontal.png)

This is the 'InDev' branch of Blade, the one that i use to work on new features, to create new versions.
It's also the branch that contains the 'nightly' builds, that are not stable but are the latest of all.
If you want to work on blade you should work on that branch, and never on 'master' ; master is the location of the code of the stable releases only.
Features get added to the indev branch and tested in nightly builds, to be then after i'm sure there is no bug added in 'master' branch and the next stable release.
