[V 1.0](https://github.com/Valou3433/blade-player/releases/download/v1.0/blade-1.0.apk)


Blade first release. No support for SoundCloud at the moment, as i can't get an API key.
NOTE : known bugs : crashes on null playlist name, multiple issues on OREO+ systems.

This version is the first stable version of Blade, and should be stable. However i could not test it on Oreo+ devices, so i'm not really sure of the behaviour on theses systems.
Keep in mind that this is the first Blade release, and that more features will be coming soon ; if you really want more you can download the Nightly builds, or add features yourself by forking the repo :)
