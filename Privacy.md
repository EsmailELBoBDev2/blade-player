# Privacy Policy

This document informs you of the developer's policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when Blade software is used and the choices you have associated with that data.

I, Valou3433, try to collect the less possible data necessary ; this document will inform you about all data possibly collected.

## Permission and Access

Blade will require permission to read and write your external storage. It will never access it directly, this is only to be able to read all musics and create/remove playlists or songs.
Blade also need to access the Internet, to communicate with Spotify/Deezer and also to send crash reports.

## Crash reports sending

As Blade is still a young project, i need to get informations when it doesn't work to make it work.
If you encounter a bug during the use of Blade, please open an issue on GitHub and i'll fix it.
After that, when Blade crashes (which is the worst possible bug, the app stop working), i need to know why.
In this way, when it crashes, i use an open-source library named ACRA to send me the crash reports, which only gives me which line in which code source file caused the crash.

## Spotify and Deezer access

We will never collect any of your Spotify/Deezer login data. We use the OAuth3 protocol to connect Blade to Deezer/Spotify, which means we never get your login/password.

We only get your music library and playlists from theses sources, to show them to you in the app.

Remember that Deezer and Spotify are third-party services, and i can't control them. Even if i don't collect data about what you are listening or anything, i can't assure you that theses services won't.
I'm not responsible of Deezer and Spotify data collection ; if you don't agree with that just use Blade without linking it to Spotify/Deezer.

## Transfer Of Data

When the third-party services contained in the app are used, your information, including personal data, may be transferred to computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

## Service Providers

Blade-Player employs the services of third party companies Spotify and Deezer to facilitate it's services and to perform service-related services or to assist in analyzing how our service is used.

These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

## Links To Other Sites

Blade-Player contains links to other services that are not directly operated by the developer. If you click on a third party service either Spotify or Deezer in the app, you will be directed to that third party's site. 

The developer has no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

The developer may update this policy as there will be further development of the software and these developments will likely not be consistent with this current policy.
